Born and raised in Los Angeles, near the LAX airport and also Great Western Forum. I am a Huge Dodger fan and am thrilled to have witnessed one of the best Dodger Franchise in history. I am not sorry the Dodgers didnt win the World Series, in fact I am grateful and honored to say the Dodgers won the National League.
